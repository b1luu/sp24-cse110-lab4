1. 3 since it prints the number of elements that i keeps track of, so in this case it is the number of elements which is 3 in the array prices. 

2. 150 and this is the discounted price of the last item of the array and it is not rounded.

3. 150 is the final price after rounding. 

4. Blank since we did not use console.log(). 

5. This will cause an error since i is block-scoped.

6. Error since it is attempting to access a block-scoped variable.

7. Error since it is trying to access a block0scoped variable.

8. Error since it is trying to access a block0scoped variable from line 3 and 4 utilizing the keyword let. 

9. Referene error from the keyword const

10. 3 since it the keyword const keeps the prices length to be 3 always.

11. The function output specifically is blank, but it will return the price of items after discount of prices at 50%.
